| Sept 3  | 2:30 - 3pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In class, I focused on coding the case where winning the game would be impossible, but I first needed to better grasp how the snakes and ladders 2d arrays worked. |
| Sept 4  |  9-9:30am  |                                                                                                             First I started by coding a "greedy" algorithm where I would take any ladder I could, or move 6 steps. This resulted in thousands of moves to finish instead of the expected small values. To fix this, I decided to look into DFS and BFS because I remembered they are efficient for searching. I then landed on BFS over DFS because DFS would search all the possibiliies before finding an optimal solution, whereas BFS would just reach the winning square and end. |
| Sept 4  | 9:30-10am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I started my BFS by utalizing my old BFS code for MazeSolver in CS2. I made that old code work by creating a static class called BoardPosition with a board position and number of moves, to mimic a MazeCell whilst having the necessary amount of info for our problem. |
| Sept. 4 |  8-8:30pm  | After I got a seemingly working BFS, I was confused because I kept getting answers in the thousands instead of small answers. So after a lot of debugging, I went to the testcases and realized that the boardsize parameter would be 100 for a 10 by 10 board, where my logic was treating boardsize like it would be 10 for a 10x10, and then squaring it to find the winning square. So unknowingly I was solving for a 10,000 square board, not a 100 one. After I realized that mistake everything worked out (which makes me wonder if my first solution would have worked too). |
